# Passamaquoddy Traditional Knowledge Labels

The Passamaquoddy Tribe has defined three TK Labels, you can find them [here](https://passamaquoddypeople.com/passamaquoddy-traditional-knowledge-labels). The three labels are TK A, TK O and TK NC.

Here we would like to model this three labels and illustrate how ODRL could be used to describe a TK Label. **Note that none of the serialization here is verified by the community.**
